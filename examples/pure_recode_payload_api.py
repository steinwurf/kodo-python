    Pure recode example using the Payload API.

    This example is very similar to encode_recode_decode_simple.py.
    The only difference is that this example uses a pure recoder instead of
    a decoder acting as a recoder. By "pure", we mean that the recoder will
    not decode the incoming data, it will only re-encode it.
    This example shows how to use an encoder, recoder, and decoder to
    simulate a simple relay network as shown below. For simplicity,
    we have error free links, i.e. no data packets are lost when being
    sent from encoder to recoder to decoder:

            +-----------+      +-----------+      +------------+
            |  encoder  |+---->| recoder   |+---->|  decoder   |
            +-----------+      +-----------+      +------------+

    The pure recoder does not need to decode all symbols, and its "capacity"
    for storing symbols can be limited. These stored coded symbols are
    linear combinations of previously received symbols. When a new symbol is
    received, the pure recoder will combine it with its existing symbols
    using random coefficients.
    The pure recoder can produce a random linear combination of the stored
    coded symbols, which can be processed by a regular decoder.

    # and the symbol size in bytes

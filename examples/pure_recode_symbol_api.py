    Pure recode example using the Symbol API.

    This example is very similar to pure_recode_payload_api.py.
    The difference is that this example uses the low-level Symbol API of the
    pure recoder instead of the high-level Payload API.
    Similarly, the pure recoder will not decode the incoming data, it will
    only re-encode it and we use the same relay network as shown below.
    For simplicity, we have error free links, i.e. no data packets are lost
    when being sent from encoder to recoder to decoder:

            +-----------+      +-----------+      +------------+
            |  encoder  |+---->| recoder   |+---->|  decoder   |
            +-----------+      +-----------+      +------------+

    The pure recoder does not need to decode all symbols, and its "capacity"
    for storing symbols can be limited. These stored coded symbols are
    linear combinations of previously received symbols. When a new symbol is
    received, the pure recoder will combine it with its existing symbols
    using random coefficients.
    The pure recoder can produce a random linear combination of the stored
    coded symbols, which can be processed by a regular decoder.
